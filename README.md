Emergency Appeal
This project represents more than a website — it is a cry for help from the faces of children who’ve been denied the one place they felt safe and inspired: their learning space.

We are running a charity-based school in Nigeria that provides free Mathematics and Computer Technology education to underprivileged children. For many of these kids, it’s their only opportunity to dream, to learn, and to eventually rise out of poverty.

But everything came crashing down when, without prior notice, the property owner forcefully evicted us. The school space — a modest, vibrant hub of learning and creativity — was taken from us.

Now, the children are left confused, displaced, and disheartened.

Their little hands that once held chalk and keyboards now clutch onto hope.

Their faces, once brightened by knowledge and care, now wear expressions of loss and longing.

Our Goal
We are raising funds to:

Acquire a permanent and safe learning space 🏫

Purchase more computers, furniture, and educational software 💻

Continue providing quality instruction in math and computing 📐⌨️

Give these children back their right to dream, learn, and thrive 🌍✨

Volunteering your time or technical support

Final Note
"When you look into the eyes of these children, you don’t just see a need — you see a future that can be rescued."

Let’s not let frustration and eviction be their last chapter.
Let’s write a new one — full of hope, growth, and opportunity.
